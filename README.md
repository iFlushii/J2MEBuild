### J2MEBuild.
This project allows you to create J2ME projects from CLI.  
To get help run `j2mebuild.py` with argument "help".  
Some code was taken from [this repo](https://github.com/MyHoldFast/J2ME-Compiler/).  
Runs smoothly with [Python 3](https://python.org/downloads) and [Java Development Kit 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot).
